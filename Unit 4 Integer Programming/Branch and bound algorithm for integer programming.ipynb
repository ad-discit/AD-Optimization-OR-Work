    "\n",
    "In this assignment, I used a quasi brute-force approach to find the optimal project combination. This guarantees the correct solution but has significant drawbacks. The method is inefficient for larger datasets, as evaluating all combinations leads to exponential growth, making it an NP-hard problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brute-Force Approach:\n",
    "- **Pros**: Guarantees finding the optimal solution by exhaustively evaluating all possible combinations.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Computationally expensive and impractical for large datasets due to exponential growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalability Issues:\n",
    "For small datasets, evaluating every combination is feasible. However, for larger datasets, this becomes infeasible, highlighting the need for more efficient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Approaches:\n",
    "- **Divide and Conquer**: As seen in class it breaks the problem into smaller subproblems, solving them independently.\n",
    "- **Heuristic and Metaheuristic Algorithms**: Techniques like Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, or Tabu Search provide near-optimal solutions more efficiently.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Programming**: Solves combinatorial problems more efficiently by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions.\n"
