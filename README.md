# AD-Optimization-OR-Work
This semester, under the guidance of Professor M. Vill√† i Freixa.
I'll delve into Optimization and Operations Research, exploring system modeling principles, algorithm efficiency, problem complexity, search space considerations (feasible regions), and gaining practical experience in programming.

# Topics Covered:

Introduction to Operations Research:
- Definition and scope of OR.
- Application of quantitative methods.

System Modeling Principles:
- Creating simplified representations.
- Mathematical structures, equations, matrices.

Algorithm Efficiency and Problem Complexity

Search Space Complexity:
- Exploration of complex problems.
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
- Analyzing exponential search spaces.

Software for Operations Research:
- Introduction to modeling tools.
- Practical application using Google Colab.
